## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3B5998) to reflect a sense of professionalism, intelligence, and trust.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8F0FE), providing a gentle contrast with the primary color, remaining easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: A slightly brighter, analogous blue (#4B7BEC) to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look.
- Use simple, professional icons for file upload and settings. The style should be consistent with the 'Inter' font, i.e., geometric and sans-serif.
- A clean and intuitive layout, focusing on ease of use. The chat interface should be the prominent feature.
